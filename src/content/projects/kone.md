Offline Web Application for selling elevator maintenance contracts. The application ran on a standard tablet browser. A key requirement for sales personnel was to visit customer locations, documenting numerous elevator and environmental details necessary to formulate suitable maintenance offers. Offline support was essential due to fluctuating network conditions at many installation sites.

I joined the project when it was already in the production pilot phase. We started migrating the codebase to TypeScript in order to enhance maintainability and adapt to the evolving needs of our expanding customer base. I was involved in every part of the tech stack but with an emphasis on making the crucial parts more solid (a.o. Offline Web Application).
