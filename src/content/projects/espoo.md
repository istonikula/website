The project was focused on producing services facilitating online grant applications and comprehensive management of the grant process. There were several different grant types (e.g. youth, culture, sports) with differing requirements in both the applying and managing phases.

From a technical standpoint, this was a greenfield project, allowing our team to build from the ground up and select the entire technology stack. As the initial member to dedicate full-time effort to the project, I laid foundations to the way how backend services were developed. I actively engaged in every aspect of the stack, frequently ensuring that the outcome as a whole was kept consistent and maintainable.
