Apart from its online services on veikkaus.fi, Veikkaus maintains a significant presence in grocery stores, kiosks, and horse race tracks. At these locations, dedicated terminal devices handle the sale of Veikkaus products, including draw and sport games, Toto, and scratchers. This project aimed not only to upgrade the terminal devices themselves but also to modernise the entire interaction between the sales clerk and the customer. In addition, during 2023, all these Veikkaus games began to require mandatory customer identification.

I joined the project after two years of active development. The implementation of Toto, the most complex game, had already been completed, and some features for Lotto had been initiated. The remaining draw games, all sport games, and scratchers were yet to be developed. Additionally, because the terminal software was designed to operate on custom Linux-based hardware, ongoing development and testing efforts were necessary to provide continuous feedback and facilitate improvements with the hardware manufacturer.

I had the opportunity to troubleshoot low-level issues associated with the custom hardware, engage in frontend development for the terminal app, and contribute to the development of mission-critical backend services. These backend services required integration with various supporting services developed by other teams within Veikkaus or game systems from 3rd party suppliers.
